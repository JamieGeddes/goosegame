# goosegame

goosegame is a game featuring a mischievous goose as its main character. The player controls the goose, guiding them to control chaos among a small village. The aim of the game is to cause as much disruption to the villagers, completing a pre-set list of tasks, such as hiding important artefacts from villagers, tricking them into doing silly things, or trapping them in their own gardens.

The game takes inspiration from the Untitled Goose Game. The Goose.png image should be used for the start screen. The Goose_rio.png file shows the goose wearing a fighter pilot helmet, which should be introduced into the game at some stage.
